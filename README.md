# Aquawaste Collector ‚Äî IoT Water Pollution Monitoring & Tracking System üåäü§ñ

Aquawaste Collector is a hybrid IoT system that both collects floating solid waste from water surfaces and monitors water quality in real time. The project combines a joystick-controlled robotic boat (NRF24L01 remote control) with a sensor suite (pH, turbidity, DS18B20 water temperature, DHT11 air temp & humidity, ultrasonic water-level detection). Sensor data is uploaded to ThingSpeak via ESP8266/ESP32 and critical alerts can be sent via GSM SMS.

This repository provides firmware, wiring diagrams, configuration examples, and instructions to reproduce and extend the system.

The system integrates three major subsystems working in coordination:  

1. **Waste Collection Unit**  
   - A robotic boat equipped with dual DC motors for navigation.  
   - Controlled manually via a wireless joystick remote using **NRF24L01** modules.  
   - Motor driver (L298N) regulates speed and direction of the motors.  

2. **Environmental Monitoring Unit**  
   - Sensors: Turbidity, pH, DS18B20 Temperature, Ultrasonic, and DHT11.  
   - Data acquisition handled by **Arduino + ESP8266**.  
   - Real-time monitoring with LED alerts for critical conditions.  

3. **IoT Communication & Cloud Unit**  
   - Sensor data transmitted to **ThingSpeak** cloud via ESP8266 for visualization.  
   - SMS alerts enabled through GSM module for threshold violations.  
   - Scalable for future integration with autonomous navigation or AI-based decision-making.

The system follows a simple flow:  
1. **Initialization** ‚Äì Sensors, communication modules, and motor drivers are set up.  
2. **Data Collection** ‚Äì Turbidity, pH, temperature, humidity, and water level are continuously measured.  
3. **Processing** ‚Äì Values are filtered, converted, and compared against safe thresholds.  
4. **Action** ‚Äì Waste is collected via the robotic boat, and alerts are triggered when critical conditions are detected.  
5. **Transmission** ‚Äì Sensor data is sent to ThingSpeak via Wi-Fi and SMS alerts are delivered through the GSM module.  
6. **Visualization** ‚Äì Users can monitor real-time water quality parameters on the cloud dashboard.
